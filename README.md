### Current Implementation
Cave Gems is fully operational and integrated within my Shopify website/store. As the owner of **The Cave Collectables**, both a physical and online store, I have successfully implemented this customizable gamified member portal app within my business. It has proven to be an effective tool in building customer loyalty, retaining customers, and attracting new ones.
